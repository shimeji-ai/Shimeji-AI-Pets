# Runtime Required Sprites (Chrome + Desktop)

This folder contains only the sprites currently required by the active runtimes.

- Total: `33` sprites
- Chrome extension uses all `33`
- Desktop currently uses `32` (desktop does not use `sit-edge-legs-up.png` right now)

Use this folder as the clean handoff set for character design/replacement.

Notes:
- Keep the same filenames.
- Keep canvas size and baseline consistent across all sprites.
- `icon.png` is not part of runtime animation frames and is intentionally excluded.
